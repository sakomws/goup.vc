# Group Dashboard Guide

Use the Group Dashboard to run your group day to day. This is where organizers
manage events, team coordination, member communication, and sponsors.

If you are still selecting the right workspace, read
[Choose Your Dashboard](../getting-started/choose-dashboard.md).

## What This Dashboard Owns

The alliance dashboard sets shared structure. The group dashboard is where you
run the group.

Main areas:

- [Settings](/dashboard/group?tab=settings ':ignore'): group identity and public profile quality.
- [Team](/dashboard/group?tab=team ':ignore'): organizer membership and roles.
- [Analytics](/dashboard/group?tab=analytics ':ignore'): group-level growth trends.
- [Events](/dashboard/group?tab=events ':ignore'): full event lifecycle operations.
- [Members](/dashboard/group?tab=members ':ignore'): membership view and group-wide communication.
- [Sponsors](/dashboard/group?tab=sponsors ':ignore'): reusable sponsor records for event use.
- [Logs](/dashboard/group?tab=logs ':ignore'): read-only audit trail for group dashboard actions.

## Access and Context

To operate here, you need:

1. Logged-in session.
2. Group-team membership.
3. A selected alliance and group.

If the right alliance or group is not selected yet, some actions stay unavailable until you pick
them.

## Roles and Permissions

Group role permissions are fixed and enforced by middleware plus database checks:

| Group role       | Group read | Events    | Members   | Settings  | Sponsors  | Team      |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| `admin`          | Yes        | Write     | Write     | Write     | Write     | Write     |
| `events-manager` | Yes        | Write     | Read only | Read only | Read only | Read only |
| `viewer`         | Yes        | Read only | Read only | Read only | Read only | Read only |

![Group roles](../screenshots/dashboard-group-members-list-roles.png)

Alliance role interaction:

- Alliance `admin` and `groups-manager` also have group write permissions inside that alliance.
- Alliances can restrict group team management so only alliance `admin` and `groups-manager`
  roles can add, update, or remove group team members.
- Alliance `viewer` remains read-only at group scope.

UI behavior:

- Controls are disabled when your role does not allow that action.
- Server-side authorization still applies.

![Alliance disabled form](../screenshots/dashboard-group-permissions-role.png)

## Settings: Group Identity

Use `Settings` to maintain the information people rely on before joining or attending.

You can manage:

- Name, category, and descriptions.
- Branding assets.
- Location search and map coordinates.
- Optional pretty URL slug for public group links.
- Social links.
- Optional tags, photo gallery, and extra links.

Category and region options in this form come from the defined alliance's
[Group Categories](/dashboard/alliance?tab=group-categories ':ignore') and
[Regions](/dashboard/alliance?tab=regions ':ignore') tabs.

Brand inheritance model in this scope:

- If a group logo is not set, OCG falls back to the alliance logo.
- If a group banner or mobile banner is not set, OCG falls back to the alliance banner.
- If a group Open Graph image is not set, group and event link previews fall
  back to the alliance Open Graph image.

Pretty URL slugs are optional. When set, OCG uses the pretty slug in generated
group and event links, while the generated group slug continues to work.

Pretty URL slug rules:

- Use lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, and hyphens only.
- Start and end with a letter or number.
- Do not use consecutive hyphens.
- Use 50 characters or fewer.
- Use a value that is unique within the alliance and different from the
  generated slug.

Field requirements and limits are shown inline in the settings form while editing.

## Payments: Group Recipient Setup

Ticketed events are available only when two prerequisites are both true:

1. Your OCG deployment has payments enabled.
2. The group has a payment recipient configured in `Settings`.

Group-level setup:

- Open [Settings](/dashboard/group?tab=settings ':ignore').
- Enter the group's Stripe connected account ID in the payments section.
- Save the group settings.

OCG expects a Stripe connected account identifier in the `acct_...` format.
The dashboard does not create or onboard the Stripe account for you.

For the full Stripe-side setup, including connected-account onboarding and
payout details, follow [Payments Setup](payments-setup.md).

If the group leaves the payment recipient blank, organizers can still run free
RSVP events, but ticketed events stay unavailable for that group, including
zero-price tiers.

If you do not see payment controls in the event editor at all, your deployment may not have
payments enabled yet. That setup is managed outside the public dashboard documentation.

Organizer permissions:

- Configuring the group payment recipient requires `group.settings.write`.
- Creating paid events and approving/rejecting refund requests require `group.events.write`.
- Organizers with read access can still view attendee refund status in `Event -> Attendees`.

## Team: Organizer Capacity

`Team` supports invitation-driven organizer management with role updates for existing members.

Current assignable roles:

- `admin`
- `events-manager`
- `viewer`

Important protection:

- The last accepted group admin cannot be removed or demoted.

This protects continuity for critical event operations and approvals.

!> The last accepted group admin cannot be removed or demoted.
Add another accepted team member first, then retry.

When you add a group team member, OCG sends an invitation with a link to
[User Dashboard -> Invitations](/dashboard/user?tab=invitations ':ignore').

Invitation acceptance and dashboard visibility details are covered in
[User Dashboard Guide](user-dashboard.md).

## Analytics: Delivery Health

Group analytics focuses on operational output:

- Members.
- Events.
- Attendees.
- Page views for the group page and all event pages.

Each metric includes running totals and monthly trends, so it is easier to tell whether growth is
steady over time or mainly tied to isolated spikes.

The `Page views` section starts with total group and event page views, then breaks views down by
page type with daily charts for the last month.

Analytics values can lag briefly due to caching.

![Group dashboard analytics](../screenshots/dashboard-group-analytics.png)

## Members: Communication

`Members` provides two practical capabilities:

- Browse member list and join dates.
- Send plain-text email to all group members.

`Send email` reaches both group members and group team members who receive optional
notifications. The email form includes a required `Subject`, defaults it to the group name, and
sends the message body as plain text.

![Group members area](../screenshots/dashboard-group-members.png)

## Sponsors: Reusable Profiles

Sponsors are managed once and reused across events, reducing repetitive event setup.
They can also be individually featured on the public group page.

Typical flow:

1. Create sponsor records in [Sponsors](/dashboard/group?tab=sponsors ':ignore').
2. Mark the sponsors you want highlighted on the public group page.
3. Attach sponsors in event editing (`Hosts & Speakers` section).
4. Update sponsor details once to keep future events consistent.

![Group sponsors area](../screenshots/dashboard-group-sponsors.png)

## Events: Operations Hub

Most organizer time is spent in [Events](/dashboard/group?tab=events ':ignore'): creating drafts,
publishing, managing CFS, reviewing submissions, and running attendance/check-in flows.

List classification is based on event start time:

- `Upcoming events` includes items whose start time has not yet passed.
- `Past events` includes items whose start time has already passed.

![Group events area](../screenshots/dashboard-group-events.png)

Starting from [Add Event](/dashboard/group/events/add ':ignore') gives organizers a structured editor with
tabbed sections that map directly to delivery needs (details, schedule, roles, sessions, CFS,
attendees).

Waitlist-aware event operations also include:

- A `Waitlist enabled` toggle in event details.
- Waitlist requires a numeric event capacity; unlimited-capacity events cannot enable it.
- Optional `Registration Opens` and `Registration Closes` fields in `Date & Venue`.
  When configured, the window controls public registration, invitation requests, starting ticket
  checkout, registration-question answers, and automatic waitlist promotion.
  Registration open and close dates cannot be after the event start, and close must be after open
  when both are set. If only an open date is set, registration closes at event start; if both fields
  are blank, no registration window is applied. Active checkout holds may still complete payment and
  required registration questions after the public window closes, until the hold expires.
- Separate `Attendees`, `Requests`, and `Waitlist` tabs inside the event editor, depending on event
  enrollment settings, with table search, sorting, and filters for day-of operations.
- Automatic promotion from the waitlist when attendees leave, capacity increases, or capacity is
  removed, but only while registration is open.
- Waitlist recipients included in event cancellation notifications.

Invitation-review event operations include:

- A `Require Invitation Approval` toggle in event details.
- Invitation review cannot be combined with waitlist or paid tickets.
- Invitation requests appear in a separate `Requests` tab for organizer review. The tab defaults to
  pending requests and can be filtered to all, accepted, or rejected requests.
- Accepting a request creates a confirmed attendee if capacity allows.
- Rejecting a request records the decision without creating an attendee.

Organizer-created event invitations are managed from the event `Attendees` tab:

- Organizers with `group.events.write` can invite a registered platform user or enter an email
  address for someone who has not registered yet.
- Email invitations are for LF SSO accounts. The invited email must match the invitee's LF account
  primary email, or the invitee will not be able to accept.
- Manual invitations are available for free RSVP events only, not ticketed events.
- Manual invitations are an organizer override for registration windows and capacity. Invitees can
  accept and answer required registration questions outside the public registration window.
- Pending invitations appear in the attendee table with invitation status and can be canceled
  before the invitee accepts.
- If an invitee rejects the invitation, the attendee row stays rejected and the same user cannot be
  invited to that event again.

[Public Site Guide](public-site.md).

## Audit: Logs

`AUDIT -> Logs` is the last section in the left dashboard menu. It provides a read-only record of
group dashboard activity for the selected group.

Coverage in this view includes:

- Group settings updates.
- Group team changes.
- Sponsor changes.
- Event lifecycle actions such as add, update, publish, unpublish, cancel, and delete.
- Check-ins, CFS submission reviews, and custom notification sends.

Table behavior:

- Rows are ordered by newest first by default.
- You can filter by `Action`, `Actor`, and date range.
- You can switch ordering between newest first and oldest first.
- Pagination keeps the active filters applied.
- `Details` opens a popover when an audit row has extra metadata such as a role or notification
  subject.

Target display behavior:

- OCG shows the resource type plus the current resource name.
- If the current resource row no longer exists, the audit row still remains and falls back to the
  stored resource identifier.

Scope note:

- This screen is group-dashboard focused.
- Some overlapping actions, such as `group_updated`, can also appear in the alliance dashboard
  audit view when they match that dashboard's accepted scope.
