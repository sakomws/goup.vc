# Public Site Guide

The public site is where people discover alliances, join groups, RSVP to
events, check in, and, when enabled, submit talks to Call for Speakers.

If you are not sure where to start, this is the best place to begin.

If you prefer a faster task-oriented run-through first, use
[Quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart.md).

## Discover Quickly in Explore

[Explore](/explore ':ignore') is designed to help you move from
"too many options" to a confident choice.

For events, begin broad and narrow in this order: alliance, type, category,
and date range. Keeping this order avoids over-filtering too early.

?> Start with alliance, then add type, category, and date range only if you
need to narrow results further.

Explore gives you multiple view styles, and the available options depend on
what you are browsing:

- `Events`: `List` and `Calendar`.
- `Groups`: `List` and `Map`.

Quick guide:

- `List` helps when you want to scan titles, dates, and descriptions quickly.
- `Calendar` helps when you are planning around time conflicts and busy periods.
- `Map` helps when place matters, like finding nearby groups.

## Join Groups

Joining a group is how you stay connected to a alliance over time. Events
come and go, but groups are where ongoing participation happens.

On the group page, `Join group` adds you as a member. If you later step back,
`Leave group` removes you from the group.

Helpful details:

- Logged-out users are prompted to sign in with LinkedIn.
- The join button may take a moment to update after the page loads.
- After you join, OCG sends a welcome message with a link back to the group page.

![Group page and membership controls](../screenshots/group-page.png)

## RSVP and Attend Events

The event page is the best place to check event details. Use it for RSVP,
logistics, links, and speaker-program status.

Click `Attend event` to RSVP. If the event is virtual/hybrid and meeting access
is configured, attendees can see `Join meeting` when the event is live.

Helpful details:

- The RSVP button may take a moment to update after the page loads.
- RSVP actions are available only before the event start time.
- If organizers configured a registration window, the event page shows when registration opens or
  closes. RSVP, starting ticket checkout, invitation requests, waitlist joining, and
  registration-question answers are disabled outside that window. If you already have an active
  ticket hold, you can complete payment and required registration questions until the hold expires.
- Canceling RSVP is immediate through `Cancel attendance`.
- After RSVP, OCG sends a confirmation message with a calendar file attached.
- If organizers configured registration questions, clicking `Attend event` or `Buy ticket` opens
  a question form first. Required answers must be completed before registration can continue.
- Some events use invitation review. In that case, `Attend event` becomes
  `Request invitation`, and meeting access/check-in are available only after an
  organizer accepts the request.

![Event page and attendance actions](../screenshots/event-page.png)

When an event has a capacity limit, the button behavior depends on organizer settings:

- If the event is full and waitlist is disabled, it is sold out.
- If the event is full and waitlist is enabled, `Attend event` becomes `Join waiting list`.
- When the waitlist is enabled and already has people queued, the event page can show a public
  `(Waitlist: N)` count next to capacity.
- Logged-out visitors are asked to sign in before they can RSVP or join the waitlist.
- If you later leave the waitlist, that change is immediate.
- If a seat opens because someone leaves, capacity increases, or organizers remove the capacity
  limit, OCG can promote you automatically while registration is open and send a promotion
  notification.
- If organizers remove the capacity limit entirely, everyone still on the waitlist is promoted
  while registration is open.
- If a waitlist promotion or organizer invitation requires registration questions, finish them from
  `My Events` before your registration is complete.
- Organizer invitations can still be completed outside the public registration window.

For invitation-review events:

- Pending requests do not reserve seats.
- Organizers accept requests while capacity remains available.
- `Invitation requested` means the request is waiting for review.
- `Request rejected` means organizers declined the request; resubmitting is not available.
- Accepted requests become regular attendance and send the usual event confirmation email with
  calendar attachment.

!> RSVP is only available before event start time.
You must RSVP first to be eligible for event-day check-in.

## Check In on Event Day

Check-in confirms that you attended the event, so time limits and attendance
rules apply.

Window rules:

- Opens 2 hours before start time.
- Closes at the end of the event day.
- For multi-day events, closes at the end of the last day.

You cannot check in if:

- You are not an attendee.
- The event is not published or active.
- The check-in window is closed.

!> Check-in is only available when you are an attendee, the event is active,
and the check-in window is open.

## Submit to Call for Speakers (CFS)

The CFS flow happens in two places:

1. Create reusable proposals in
   [User Dashboard -> Session proposals](
   /dashboard/user?tab=session-proposals ':ignore').
2. Submit those proposals from event pages where CFS is open.

This lets you reuse proposal content while keeping each event submission
separate, including status, reviewer feedback, labels, and outcomes.

Track progress in
[User Dashboard -> Submissions](/dashboard/user?tab=submissions ':ignore').

For full speaker workflow detail, continue with
[User Dashboard Guide](user-dashboard.md). For organizer-side review and event
lifecycle controls, see [Event Operations](event-operations.md).

## Use Jobs and Mock Interviews

[Jobs](/jobs ':ignore') helps members find opportunities shared through the GOUP network. Use it to
search roles, filter by location or remote-friendly work, and open role details.

[Mock Interviews](/jobs/mock-interviews ':ignore') helps members prepare for those opportunities.
Logged-in members can request practice by choosing interview type, target company category,
seniority, location, and availability. Organizers schedule matches from the Jobs dashboard.

For the full workflow, read [Jobs and Mock Interviews](jobs.md).

## Use Stats for Platform Context

[Stats](/stats ':ignore') helps organizers and contributors understand
momentum at a glance: groups, members, events, and attendees over time.

![Stats page overview](../screenshots/stats-page.png)

## Recommended Member Flow

1. Discover in [Explore](/explore ':ignore').
2. Join one or more groups.
3. RSVP to events.
4. Check in on event day.
5. Browse jobs or request mock interview practice.
6. Use CFS features when you are ready to submit talks.

When you transition into organizer responsibilities, use
[Choose Your Dashboard](../getting-started/choose-dashboard.md).
