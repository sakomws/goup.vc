# Event Operations

This guide covers the full event lifecycle in
[Group Dashboard -> Events](/dashboard/group?tab=events ':ignore'): draft creation, configuration,
publishing, delivery-day execution, and controlled retirement.

For scope boundaries and non-event responsibilities, pair this with
[Group Dashboard Guide](group-dashboard.md).

**Sections:**

- [Lifecycle Model](#lifecycle-model)
- [Authorization Model](#authorization-model)
- [Events List: Work Queue](#events-list-work-queue)
- [Add Event: Draft First](#add-event-draft-first)
- [Event Editor Tabs](#event-editor-tabs)
- [CFS Workflow (End to End)](#cfs-workflow-end-to-end)
- [Automatic Meeting Creation](#automatic-meeting-creation)
- [Paid Events, Tickets, Discounts, Refunds](#paid-events-tickets-discounts-refunds)

- [Publish, Unpublish, Cancel, Delete](#publish-unpublish-cancel-delete)
- [Public Event Result](#public-event-result)
- [Event-Day Checklist](#event-day-checklist)

## Lifecycle Model

Treat event operations as a staged workflow, not one big form submission:

1. Build a complete and trustworthy draft.
2. Publish only when attendee-facing data is ready.
3. Run delivery-day operations (attendance, check-in, communication).
4. Retire intentionally (unpublish, cancel, or delete).

When phase 1 is done well, every downstream step is faster and safer.

## Authorization Model

Event write operations require the `group.events.write` permission.

This is granted by:

- Group `admin`
- Group `events-manager`
- Alliance `admin`
- Alliance `groups-manager`

Read-only roles can still view event data but cannot mutate it.

UI behavior:

- Event action controls are disabled when your role cannot perform the operation.
- Middleware authorization is enforced server-side for every write endpoint.

![Group disabled form](../screenshots/dashboard-group-permissions-role.png)

## Events List: Work Queue

[Events](/dashboard/group?tab=events ':ignore') is your organizer queue. `Upcoming events` and `Past events`
help you separate work that needs intervention now from historical cleanup.

From each row, you can:

- Create with [Add event](/dashboard/group?tab=events ':ignore').
- Open edit mode.
- Open the public event page (when available).
- Publish/unpublish.
- Cancel.
- Delete.

State intent:

- `Draft`: still being authored.
- `Published`: live for public participation.
- `Canceled`: no longer running. If the event was published, its public page remains available
  with canceled-state messaging.

![Events operations list](../screenshots/dashboard-group-events.png)

## Add Event: Draft First

The safest pattern is draft-first, publish-second.

Recommended flow:

1. Click `Add Event`.
2. Optionally copy an earlier event to reuse structure.
3. Complete each editor tab.
4. Save.
5. Publish only after a full quality pass.

Copying is intentionally partial so stale logistics are not carried forward:

?> After copying an event, run a quick logistics sweep before publishing.
Time-bound and meeting-specific fields are intentionally not carried forward.

- Start/end dates are cleared.
- Registration window dates are cleared.
- Sessions are not copied.
- Meeting links are not copied.
- Some older host/speaker fields may need manual cleanup.

![Add event editor](../screenshots/dashboard-group-add-event.png)

## Event Editor Tabs

The editor is organized so you can move from identity, to schedule, to speakers, to operations.

### Details

In this tab, you define attendee-facing identity and enrollment posture: name, event type,
category, description, branding assets, capacity, registration toggle, tags, and optional links.

Event category options come from the defined alliance's
[Event Categories](/dashboard/alliance?tab=event-categories ':ignore') tab.

Publish readiness checks in this tab:

- Name, type, category, and description are complete and clear.
- Branding is consistent with group/alliance standards.
- Capacity and registration policy match expected demand.

Ticketing also starts in `Details`:

- `Event Currency` sets a single currency for the event.
- `Ticket Types` lets you add attendee-facing tiers, seat counts, and date-based price windows.
- `Discount Codes` lets you add event-level promotions, availability windows, and usage limits.

Ticketing rules:

- Free tickets are allowed by setting a ticket price window amount to `0`.
- Multiple ticket types can exist on the same event.
- Early-bird pricing is modeled as multiple price windows on the same ticket type.
- Ticketed events automatically derive total capacity from ticket seat counts.
- Ticketed events always disable waitlist. The editor shows this in the waitlist field helper text.
- Ticketed events can only be created when the deployment has payments enabled and the group has
  a payment recipient configured, even if some tiers are free.
- Converting an existing RSVP event into a ticketed event requires an empty attendee list and an
  empty waitlist. If attendees already exist, keep the event as RSVP or create a new ticketed
  event instead of converting in place.

If your group is not payment-ready yet, complete
[Payments Setup](payments-setup.md) before building ticketed events.

Waitlist control also lives here:

- `Waitlist enabled` is an explicit toggle, separate from `capacity`.
- Enabling the waitlist requires a numeric capacity value.
- Leaving `Capacity` blank makes the event unlimited-capacity, and unlimited-capacity events cannot
  enable waitlist.
- Waitlist cannot be combined with invitation review.
- If capacity is full and waitlist is off, the public page shows the event as sold out.
- If capacity is full and waitlist is on, people can join the waitlist instead of RSVP'ing.

!> If you want a waitlist, set capacity first.
Unlimited-capacity events always keep waitlist disabled.

### Questions

Use the `Questions` tab to define registration questions for attendees. Supported question types
are free text, single select, and multi select. Select questions use organizer-defined options,
and each question can be marked required.

Registration questions are copied when you create an event from an existing event. After attendees
submit answers, or while active checkout holds exist, the questions become read-only so existing
attendee answers and in-progress checkouts cannot drift away from the question definitions.

Invitation review also lives here:

- `Require Invitation Approval` changes the public action to `Request invitation`.
- Invitation-review events cannot use waitlist or paid tickets.
- Pending requests do not reserve seats; acceptance checks the current confirmed attendee count
  against capacity.
- If capacity is full, acceptance fails until capacity increases or an attendee leaves.
- Disabling invitation review is blocked while pending requests exist.
- Accepted requests become regular attendees and receive the standard registration confirmation.

Brand inheritance model in event details:

- If event logo is not provided, OCG falls back to group logo, then alliance logo.
- If event banner or mobile banner is not provided, OCG falls back to group banner, then
  alliance banner.

![Event details](../screenshots/dashboard-group-event-details.png)

### Date and Venue

This tab controls delivery constraints:

- Timezone, start, and end.
- Optional registration open and close dates.
- Recurrence for creating linked copies of a new event.
- Venue data for in-person/hybrid events.
- Online event details for virtual/hybrid events.
- 24-hour reminder toggle.

Timezone should be set first, then date/time. That avoids accidental scheduling drift and keeps
CFS windows aligned with the intended audience clock.

?> Set timezone first, then start/end timestamps, to avoid accidental schedule drift.

Registration windows are optional, but when configured they become the source of truth for
attendee-facing registration:

- `Registration Opens` controls when attendees can self-register, buy tickets, request invitations,
  join the waitlist, or submit registration-question answers. It cannot be after the event start
  time.
- `Registration Closes` controls when those actions stop. It cannot be after the event start time.
  When both fields are set, it must be after `Registration Opens`.
- If only an open time is set, registration stays open until the event starts.
- If only a close time is set, registration is open immediately and closes at that time.
- Public event pages and notification templates show the configured window.
- Manual organizer invitations are an override. Invitees can accept and answer required
  registration questions outside the public window.
- Active ticket checkout holds are also an override for completion only. Registration close stops
  new checkout starts, but attendees already holding a ticket can finish payment and required
  registration questions until the hold expires.

When `Send Event Reminder` is enabled, OCG sends reminder messages about 24 hours before start
time.

When adding a new event, recurrence can create multiple linked events at once:

- `Just once` creates one event.
- `Weekly` creates additional events on the same weekday as the selected start date.
- `Every two weeks` creates additional events on the same weekday every other week.
- `Monthly` creates additional events on the same ordinal weekday, such as the third Monday.

For recurring events, set `Additional Events` to the number of extra linked events to create.
The maximum is `12`. OCG creates each occurrence as a separate individual event, sharing one
series identifier, and shifts event dates, registration windows, CFS windows, sessions, ticket
windows, and discount windows by the same schedule offset. Monthly recurrence skips months that do
not contain the same ordinal weekday.

After creation, each occurrence has its own event page, editor, attendees, submissions, sessions,
tickets, and operational state. `Publish`, `Unpublish`, `Cancel`, and `Delete` can target the
whole linked series, but editing event content is intentionally one event at a time.

![Event date and venue](../screenshots/dashboard-group-event-date.png)

### Hosts, Speakers, and Organizers

In this tab, you manage event-level people and sponsor attribution:

- Add hosts from any user account on the site.
- Add visible speakers/presenters.
- Attach event sponsors from reusable sponsor records.

OCG also shows an `Organizers` section on the public event page. Organizers are snapshotted from
the accepted group team when the event is created, so later group team changes do not rewrite
existing event attribution. Use event hosts for people who should be explicitly highlighted as
running the event program.

This is where attendees understand who is running, organizing, and presenting the program.

![Event hosts and speakers](../screenshots/dashboard-group-event-hosts.png)

### Sessions

Sessions turns approved content into an actual agenda:

- Create agenda rows with time bounds.
- Keep session times inside event start/end.
- Link approved CFS submissions into the schedule.

This tab is usually most useful once review outcomes are clearer and your schedule is taking
final shape.

![Event sessions](../screenshots/dashboard-group-event-sessions.png)

![Event add session](../screenshots/dashboard-group-event-add-session.png)

### CFS

This tab configures speaker intake:

- Enable/disable CFS.
- Set open/close timestamps.
- Write CFS description shown on the event page.
- Define optional labels (tracks/topics/themes).

Label model tip: if you edit an existing label name, that rename affects submissions already using
that label.

?> Renaming a label updates existing submissions that already reference that label.

![Event CFS](../screenshots/dashboard-group-event-cfs.png)

## Paid Events, Tickets, Discounts, Refunds

Ticket purchases are attendee-self-service from the public event page.

Public purchase flow:

1. Attendee selects a ticket type.
2. Optional discount code is entered on the event page.
3. OCG creates a short seat hold.
4. Free tickets are completed immediately.
5. Paid tickets redirect to the hosted payment checkout.
6. Attendance is created immediately for free tickets, or after the payment provider confirms
   payment for paid tickets.

Ticket and discount data model:

- Ticket types are event-level and can be mixed free/paid.
- Each ticket type can have one or more date-range price windows.
- Discount codes are event-level and support fixed-amount or percentage discounts.
- Discount codes can be limited by time window, remaining uses, or total available uses.
- Remaining uses are consumed by active holds and active purchases, then restored when a hold
  expires, a free ticket is released, or a refund is finalized.

Refunds:

- Paid attendees do not use `Leave event`.
- Paid attendees use `Request refund` from the public event page.
- Organizers review refund requests in `Event -> Attendees`.
- Organizers can approve or reject the request.
- Refund requests must be submitted before the event starts.
- Organizers can still approve or reject a request later if it was submitted before the start
  time.
- Approved refunds are full refunds only.
- Rejecting a request leaves the attendee and ticket unchanged.

Audit and notifications:

- Refund requests, approvals, rejections, and completed refunds are written to audit logs.
- Organizers are notified when attendees request refunds.
- Attendees are notified when organizers approve or reject the request.

### Attendance, Invitation, and Waitlist Operations

The dashboard separates confirmed attendees from people waiting for a seat or organizer approval.

Organizer behavior:

- `Attendees` shows confirmed attendees who can be checked in, plus organizer-created event
  invitations while they are pending or rejected.
- `Requests` appears for invitation-review events. It opens on pending requests by default, with
  filters for all, pending, accepted, and rejected requests. Pending requests can be accepted or
  rejected from this tab.
- `Waitlist` shows each person's FIFO queue position based on when they joined.
- `Attendees`, `Requests`, and `Waitlist` keep search, filter, sort, and pagination state together
  while you refine the table.
- Canceling an event notifies attendees, speakers, and waitlisted users.
- Accepting or rejecting an invitation request is written to the audit log.
- Sending, canceling, accepting, or rejecting an organizer-created event invitation is written to
  the audit log.

Capacity behavior:

- If an attendee leaves and the event has a capacity limit, OCG automatically promotes the oldest
  waitlisted person while registration is open.
- If you raise event capacity on a published event and seats become available, OCG also promotes from
  the waitlist automatically while registration is open.
- If you later disable the waitlist, OCG stops accepting new waitlist sign-ups. People who were
  already on the waitlist remain queued and may still be promoted automatically when registration is
  open and attendee spots open up, for example after a cancellation or a capacity increase.
- If you clear `Capacity` and disable waitlist, OCG treats the event as unlimited-capacity and
  immediately promotes everyone still on the waitlist when registration is open.
- Attendee cancellation notifications and any promotion notifications caused by attendance
  cancellation are part of that mutation. If OCG cannot queue a required notification, the
  attendance cancellation is not saved.
- Promotion notifications caused by saving event capacity changes are part of that mutation. If OCG
  cannot queue a required promotion notification, the event update is not saved.
- Organizer-created manual invitations bypass capacity when the invitee accepts. Use them when an
  organizer intentionally wants to admit someone even if the event is full or outside the public
  registration window.

Member-facing behavior:

- Accepting an invitation-review request sends a confirmation notification with calendar
  attachment.
- Accepting an organizer-created event invitation from
  [User Dashboard -> Invitations](/dashboard/user?tab=invitations ':ignore') confirms attendance
  and sends the normal event confirmation with calendar attachment.
- Joining the waitlist sends a waitlist confirmation notification.
- Leaving the waitlist sends a waitlist removal notification.
- Promotion sends a confirmation notification with calendar attachment.
- Confirmation notifications caused by accepting invitation-review requests, accepting
  organizer-created event invitations, or completing pending registration questions are saved with
  the attendance confirmation. If OCG cannot queue the required notification, the attendance change
  is rolled back.

Paid-attendance behavior:

- Paid tickets require payment before attendance is created.
- Checkout can only start while registration is open. If registration closes before a pending
  payment is completed, an active ticket hold can still be fulfilled until the hold expires.
- If checkout is interrupted, the public event page shows a `Complete payment` state while the
  hold is still active.
- Attendees can use `Cancel checkout` before payment completes to release the hold and choose a
  different ticket or discount code.
- Free ticket attendees can still leave the event themselves.
- Paid attendees request refunds instead of leaving directly.

### Submissions

This tab is the reviewer control center:

- Filter by labels.
- Sort by submission time, rating count, or stars.
- Open review modal.
- Update status and add reviewer feedback.

Reviewer-facing statuses are:

- `Not reviewed`
- `Information requested`
- `Approved`
- `Rejected`

![Event submissions](../screenshots/dashboard-group-event-submissions.png)

#### Rating submissions

Reviewers can rate each submission on a 1–5 star scale with an optional comment. Ratings
are internal only — speakers never see ratings or rating notes. The review modal shows a
dedicated `Ratings` tab where you can set, update, or clear your rating. Other reviewers'
ratings and comments are visible in the same tab so the team can compare assessments.

The submissions list displays the average rating and total rating count for each entry.
Use the sort options (by stars or rating count) to surface the strongest or most-reviewed
submissions quickly.

When a reviewer update requires notifying the speaker, OCG sends a submission update message.

![Event submissions ratings](../screenshots/dashboard-group-event-submissions-ratings.png)

### Attendees

This tab supports delivery-day execution:

- Review attendee list and RSVP timing.
- Run manual check-in.
- Open the attendee actions menu to generate a check-in QR code for on-site flow.
- Cancel confirmed free attendance for future active events.
- Open the attendee actions menu to invite attendees to free RSVP events.
- Send all-attendee or selected-attendee operational emails.
- Download the attendee list or attendee answers as CSV.

Manual check-in bypasses attendee self-check-in timing windows, but the person must already be
registered as an attendee and the event must still be published or active.

`Cancel attendance` is available from confirmed attendee row actions for future, active events
when the attendee does not have a paid ticket. OCG removes the attendance, notifies the attendee,
and can promote the next waitlisted user when a seat opens. Paid attendees stay on the refund
workflow instead.

`Invite` is available for free RSVP events when you have event write access. You can select a
registered platform user or enter an email address. For email invitations, the address must match
the invitee's LF account primary email because they must log in with LF SSO to accept. Pending
invitations show in the attendee table and can be canceled from the row actions menu. Rejected
invitations remain visible and cannot be sent again for the same event and user.

The same attendee actions menu includes two CSV exports: `Attendees list CSV` exports attendee name,
company, title, and whether the confirmed attendee was manually invited; `Attendees list CSV
(including answers)` adds one column per registration question. Row actions also include
`View answers` when an attendee has submitted registration answers.

The attendees table can be searched by attendee identity and visible profile details, including
company and title. It can also be sorted by attendee name or RSVP date, and filtered by check-in
status, title presence, or ticket type. The invitation requests table can be sorted by requester or
request date, filtered by request status or title presence, and reset to `All` statuses when you need
to audit accepted and rejected requests. The waitlist table can be sorted by entry name or joined
date and filtered by title presence; the queue column still shows the FIFO promotion order.

`Send email` in this tab sends operational updates to attendees who receive optional notifications.
Organizers can send to all eligible attendees, including confirmed attendees and attendees who still
need to complete registration questions, or enter email selection mode to choose eligible attendees
directly from the table. Eligible attendee rows also include `Send email` for starting with that
attendee selected. The email form includes a required `Subject`, defaults it to
`{group name}: {event name}`, and sends the message body as plain text.

![Event attendees](../screenshots/dashboard-group-event-attendees.png)

## CFS Workflow (End to End)

CFS spans organizer setup, speaker submission, and review loop. Treat it as one connected system.

1. Organizer configures CFS in the event editor.
2. Organizer publishes the event.
3. Speaker prepares reusable proposals in
   [User Dashboard -> Session proposals](/dashboard/user?tab=session-proposals ':ignore').
4. Speaker submits from the event page CFS modal.
5. Organizer reviews in [Group Dashboard -> Event -> Submissions](/dashboard/group?tab=events ':ignore').
6. Speaker tracks outcomes in
   [User Dashboard -> Submissions](/dashboard/user?tab=submissions ':ignore').
7. Approved submissions are scheduled in `Sessions`.

![Session proposals list](../screenshots/dashboard-user-session-proposals-list.png)

![User submissions list](../screenshots/dashboard-user-submissions-list.png)

To submit, these requirements must be met:

!> CFS submission requires a published event, enabled/open CFS, and an eligible proposal.
Duplicate proposal submission to the same event is blocked.

- Event must be published.
- CFS must be enabled.
- CFS window must be open.
- Proposal must be eligible for submission.
- Duplicate submission of the same proposal to the same event is blocked.
- Labels must belong to that event's label set.

Response loop behavior:

- `Information requested` asks speaker for changes before re-review.
- `Resubmit` is used after requested changes are addressed.
- `Withdrawn` is speaker-initiated and typically ends active review.

Every review-side change that should reach the speaker is sent as a submission update message.

For submitter-side perspective, see [User Dashboard Guide](user-dashboard.md).

## Automatic Meeting Creation

Automatic meetings are configured in `Date and Venue -> Online event details`.
You can either use your own manual meeting link or let OCG create/manage a meeting automatically.

How automatic mode works:

- Choose `Create meeting automatically`.
- Select provider (currently `Zoom`).
- Optionally add host emails for coordination.
- Leave `Record meeting` enabled when OCG should ask the provider to record automatically, or
  turn it off when the event should not be recorded.
- Save the event.
- Publish the event to trigger meeting creation.
- Wait for sync; join link/password appear once ready.
- Meetings are automatically ended when the configured end time is reached.

Requirements for automatic mode:

!> Automatic meetings are supported only for `virtual` and `hybrid` events and require valid
schedule/capacity constraints. Manual and automatic meeting modes cannot be used together.

- Event type is `virtual` or `hybrid`.
- Start and end are set, with end after start.
- Duration is within provider limits (5 to 720 minutes).
- Event capacity is set.
- Capacity does not exceed configured provider participant limit.
- Manual meeting links are not used at the same time.

Important limitations and behavior:

!> Switching meeting modes can replace or remove meeting details.
Constraint violations can disable automatic mode until fixed.

- In-person events cannot use automatic meetings.
- Due to current technical limitations, host controls are not available in
  automatically created Zoom meetings.
- Switching automatic to manual can remove auto-created meeting details.
- Switching manual to automatic can replace existing manual links.
- Event and session recording links for automatic meetings can be replaced later
  with processed uploads hosted elsewhere.
- `Record meeting` controls whether automatically created Zoom event and session meetings request
  cloud recording.
- Zoom can send multiple raw recording URLs when participants join before or
  after the main meeting. Review the raw URLs and copy the correct one into the
  final public recording URL field, or use a processed upload.
- Event and session recordings are not public by default. Enable
  `Publish recording publicly` to show the final public recording URL.
- After an automatic meeting or session has started, OCG keeps an already synced provider meeting
  settled instead of re-queueing provider updates for a past start time.
- Schedule or type changes can disable automatic mode if constraints are no longer met.
- If sync fails, meeting errors surface in the editor until resolved.
- In deployments without automatic-meeting support, only manual meeting URL fields are available.

![Events automatic meeting](../screenshots/dashboard-group-event-automatic-meeting.png)

## Publish, Unpublish, Cancel, Delete

These actions serve different intents:

- `Publish`: make event publicly available.
- `Unpublish`: hide event without changing its canceled state.
- `Cancel`: mark event as not proceeding while keeping an already published page available as
  canceled.
- `Delete`: permanently remove from normal operations.

Message behavior:

!> `Publish` and `Cancel` can notify large participant sets.
`Unpublish` and `Delete` do not send broad attendee updates in this flow.

- `Publish` on a future unpublished event can notify group members/team members and listed
  speakers.
- `Cancel` on a future published event notifies attendees, speakers, and waitlisted users.
- Series `Publish` and `Cancel` actions aggregate affected events into grouped notifications
  instead of sending one email per event. Aggregate notifications include links to the affected
  events, but do not attach individual calendar files.
- Rescheduling a future published event can notify attendees and speakers when the start or end
  time changes by at least 15 minutes. Waitlisted users are not included in reschedule notices.
- `Unpublish` and `Delete` do not send broad attendee updates in this flow.

For `Publish`, `Cancel`, and event-editor updates that queue required publish, cancellation,
reschedule, or waitlist promotion notifications, OCG saves the event change and notification queue
entries together. If one of those required notification rows cannot be queued, the event change is
rolled back.

Automatic-meeting lifecycle in these actions:

- `Publish` triggers creation/sync for configured automatic meetings (event and session meetings).
- `Unpublish`, `Cancel`, and `Delete` trigger removal/sync for configured automatic meetings.

If an event belongs to a recurring series, `Publish`, `Unpublish`, `Cancel`, and `Delete` ask
whether to apply the action to only the selected event or all active events in that series. Series
actions are applied atomically: either every selected event is updated, or none are.

Other event edits remain individual-event operations. Updating details, dates, venue, online
meeting configuration, hosts, speakers, sponsors, sessions, CFS settings, tickets, discounts, or
attendee settings changes only the event you are editing, even when it belongs to a recurring
series.

Use the least destructive action that matches your operational goal.

![Events actions](../screenshots/dashboard-group-events-actions.png)

## Public Event Result

The public event page is the delivery surface of all organizer decisions: RSVP controls, logistics,
CFS visibility, and final agenda experience. You can reach it through [Explore](/explore ':ignore').

For attendee/member perspective, see [Public Site Guide](public-site.md).

![Public event page](../screenshots/event-page.png)

## Event-Day Checklist

?> Run this checklist shortly before start time to catch delivery issues early.

1. Confirm attendee table loads in the `Attendees` tab.
2. Open QR flow and validate the check-in URL.
3. Test one manual check-in path.
4. Prepare attendee email template for urgent updates.
5. Re-verify schedule and meeting links before start.
