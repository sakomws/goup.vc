## Architecture

GOUP is a single Rust web application backed by PostgreSQL. The server renders
most pages with Askama templates, enhances dashboard workflows with HTMX and
small browser-side JavaScript modules, and keeps domain-heavy data operations in
versioned SQL functions.

At a high level:

- `ocg-server/` contains the Axum HTTP server, authentication, handlers,
  services, templates, static assets, and background workers.
- `database/migrations/` owns schema changes, reference data, and PostgreSQL
  functions used by dashboards, public pages, notifications, and payments.
- `ocg-redirector/` is a small companion service for legacy redirects.
- `mcp/` contains the remote MCP server and operational tool catalog.
- `tests/` contains frontend unit tests and Playwright e2e coverage.
- `docs/` contains user-facing and operator-facing documentation.

The main runtime flow is:

1. Axum routes in `ocg-server/src/router/` dispatch to handlers under
   `ocg-server/src/handlers/`.
2. Handlers authorize the current user, call database traits under
   `ocg-server/src/db/`, and assemble typed template data.
3. PostgreSQL functions and queries read or mutate normalized tables, often
   returning JSON payloads for Rust to deserialize.
4. Askama templates under `ocg-server/templates/` render HTML. HTMX refreshes
   dashboard fragments without replacing the whole app shell.
5. Background services process queued notifications, email delivery, reminders,
   payments, image uploads, and meeting integrations.

For a deeper contributor guide, see [`docs/development.md`](./docs/development.md).

## Development

This repository contains a Rust web server, PostgreSQL schema/functions,
Askama templates, Tailwind CSS, browser-side JavaScript, and Playwright tests.
The app is developed from the repository root unless a command says otherwise.
For codebase architecture, request flow, and contribution patterns, see the
full [Development Guide](./docs/development.md).

### Prerequisites

Install these tools before running the app locally:

- Rust `1.95.0` or newer, preferably through `rustup`.
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS available. PostgreSQL 15, 16, or 17 works for local
  development.
- `psql`, `createdb`, and `dropdb` on your `PATH`.
- `tern` for database migrations.
- Tailwind CSS standalone CLI `v4.1.10` or compatible.
- `just` for development commands.
- Node.js and npm for frontend unit tests and Playwright e2e tests.
- Optional: `watchexec` for automatic server reloads.

On macOS with Homebrew, a typical setup is:

```bash
brew install rustup postgresql@17 postgis just go node watchexec
rustup-init
go install github.com/jackc/tern/v2@v2.3.2
```

Install Tailwind CSS from the official standalone binary release and make sure
the `tailwindcss` command is available:

```bash
curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/tailwindcss \
  https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/download/v4.1.10/tailwindcss-macos-arm64
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tailwindcss
```

Use `tailwindcss-macos-x64` instead on Intel Macs. On Linux, use the matching
`tailwindcss-linux-x64` or `tailwindcss-linux-arm64` binary.

### Configuration Directory

The `justfile` expects local config files under `$HOME/.config/ocg` by default.
You can override that path with `OCG_CONFIG`.

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/ocg"
```

Create `~/.config/ocg/tern.conf` for migrations:

```toml
[database]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 5432
database = ocg
user = postgres
password =
```

If your local Postgres user requires a password, set it in this file and export
the same value as `OCG_DB_PASSWORD` when using `just` database commands.

Create `~/.config/ocg/server.yml` for the local server:

```yaml
db:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 5432
  dbname: ocg
  user: postgres
  password: ""
  pool:
    max_size: 25
    timeouts:
      recycle: { secs: 5, nanos: 0 }
      wait: { secs: 5, nanos: 0 }

email:
  from_address: "no-reply@goup.vc"
  from_name: "GOUP Alliance"
  rcpts_whitelist: []
  smtp:
    host: ""
    port: 587
    username: ""
    password: ""

images:
  provider: db

log:
  format: pretty

server:
  addr: 127.0.0.1:9000
  base_url: http://127.0.0.1:9000
  disable_referer_checks: true
  cookie:
    secure: false
  login:
    email: true
    github: false
    linkedin: false
  oauth2: {}
  oidc: {}
```

For LinkedIn login locally, enable it and add your LinkedIn OIDC app details:

```yaml
server:
  login:
    email: false
    github: false
    linkedin: true
  oidc:
    linkedin:
      client_id: "..."
      client_secret: "..."
      issuer_url: https://www.linkedin.com
      redirect_uri: http://127.0.0.1:9000/log-in/oidc/linkedin/callback
      scopes: ["openid", "profile", "email"]
```

The LinkedIn app must allow the exact redirect URI configured above.

### Database Setup

Start PostgreSQL however you normally run it. With Homebrew:

```bash
brew services start postgresql@17
```

Create and migrate the development database:

```bash
just db-create
just db-migrate
```

If you want to reset everything:

```bash
just db-recreate
```

The schema migration enables PostGIS. If migrations fail with
`extension "postgis" is not available`, install the PostGIS package for your
PostgreSQL version and retry.

### Seed Initial Local Data

The migrations create the schema and reference data. For a useful local site,
insert a site, alliance, group category, and group:

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres -d ocg <<'SQL'
insert into site (site_id, title, description, theme)
values (
  '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
  'GOUP Alliance',
  'GOUP Alliance',
  '{"primary_color":"#0EA5E9"}'
)
on conflict do nothing;

insert into alliance (
  alliance_id,
  name,
  display_name,
  description
) values (
  '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111',
  'goup',
  'GOUP Alliance',
  'GOUP Alliance'
)
on conflict do nothing;

insert into group_category (group_category_id, alliance_id, name)
values (
  '22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222',
  '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111',
  'General'
)
on conflict do nothing;

insert into "group" (
  group_id,
  alliance_id,
  group_category_id,
  name,
  slug,
  description
) values (
  '33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333',
  '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111',
  '22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222',
  'GOUP',
  'goup',
  'GOUP members'
)
on conflict do nothing;
SQL
```

### Run the App

Start the server:

```bash
just server
```

Open the app at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

Run with auto-reload when `watchexec` is installed:

```bash
just server-watch
```

### Run with Docker Compose

If you prefer a containerized local setup, use the development compose file.
It starts PostgreSQL with PostGIS, runs migrations, seeds the initial local
data, and runs the Rust server with file watching enabled.

Build and start the development stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Run it in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

Open the app at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

The development server watches the repository for changes and rebuilds on
updates to:

- Rust code under `ocg-server/` and `ocg-redirector/`
- Askama templates under `ocg-server/templates/`
- Frontend JavaScript under `ocg-server/static/js/`
- CSS sources under `ocg-server/static/css/`
- Local server config under `.config/ocg/server.yml`

Useful compose commands:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f server
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build seed server
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

The database data is stored in the named `postgres-data` volume, so it
persists across restarts. To remove the containers and the database volume:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
```

Build without running:

```bash
just server-build
```

Build a release binary:

```bash
cargo build --release -p ocg-server
```

### Remote MCP Server

The `mcp/` directory contains a lightweight remote MCP server for GOUP
operational tools. It supports MCP JSON-RPC over HTTP at `/mcp`, lists tools via
the standard `tools/list` method, and loads tools from `mcp/tools.json`.

Run it locally:

```bash
cd mcp
npm start
```

For remote deployments, protect it with `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` and expose it behind
HTTPS. See [`mcp/README.md`](./mcp/README.md) for setup, client config, and how
to add more tools.

To set up the remote MCP server on EC2 with a generated bearer token and a
systemd service:

```bash
./scripts/setup-mcp-ec2.sh
```

Enable mutating tools, such as event creation and talk submission, only when the
endpoint is protected behind HTTPS:

```bash
MCP_ENABLE_MUTATIONS=true ./scripts/setup-mcp-ec2.sh
```

The script writes `~/.config/ocg/mcp.env`, starts the `goup-mcp` service, and
prints the NGINX `/mcp` proxy block plus the Cursor/client MCP configuration.

### Tests and Checks

Run Rust server tests:

```bash
just server-tests
```

Run database pgTAP tests:

```bash
just db-tests
```

Run database contract tests:

```bash
just db-contract-tests
```

Run frontend unit tests:

```bash
cd tests/unit
npm ci
npx playwright install
cd ../..
just frontend-unit-tests
```

Run e2e tests:

```bash
just e2e-install
just db-recreate-tests-e2e
just db-load-tests-e2e-data
just e2e-server
```

In another terminal:

```bash
just e2e-tests
```

Format and lint Rust server code:

```bash
just server-fmt-and-lint
```

Format and lint frontend/template code:

```bash
just frontend-fmt-and-lint
```

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

Pull requests to `main` run the relevant CI jobs based on changed paths:

- Rust formatting, clippy, and tests for server changes.
- Database migrations, pgTAP tests, and Rust database contract tests for
  database changes.
- Frontend unit tests and formatting checks for browser JavaScript changes.
- MCP syntax and tool catalog validation for files under `mcp/`.
- Playwright e2e suites when app, database, or e2e files change.

Pushes to `main` publish Docker images to GitHub Container Registry under this
repository:

```text
ghcr.io/sakomws/goup.vc/server
ghcr.io/sakomws/goup.vc/redirector
ghcr.io/sakomws/goup.vc/dbmigrator
```

Images are tagged with `sha-<commit>` and `latest` on `main`. The workflow uses
the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no Oracle/OCI registry secrets are required.

The production EC2 deployment is still updated by pulling from Git and
restarting systemd services, as documented below.

### Common Development Workflow

For a fresh local checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sakomws/goup.vc.git
cd goup.vc
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/ocg"
# Create tern.conf and server.yml from the examples above.
just db-create
just db-migrate
just server
```

After pulling code changes:

```bash
git pull
just db-migrate
just server
```

If the change only touches templates, Rust code, CSS, or JavaScript, you can
usually skip migrations. If database files under `database/migrations` changed,
run `just db-migrate`.

### EC2 Deployment Helper

For a fresh EC2 deployment, use the bootstrap script. It installs common
dependencies, writes config, runs migrations, seeds initial GOUP records, builds
the release binary, and installs a systemd service.

```bash
OCG_DB_PASSWORD='replace-with-a-strong-password' \
OCG_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID='replace-with-linkedin-client-id' \
OCG_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET='replace-with-linkedin-client-secret' \
OCG_ADMIN_EMAIL='you@example.com' \
./scripts/bootstrap-ec2.sh
```

### Update an Existing EC2 Deployment

After pulling new code on EC2, run migrations before rebuilding and restarting
whenever files under `database/migrations` changed. The migration script lives
under `database/migrations`, so do not run `./migrate.sh` from the repository
root:

```bash
cd ~/goup.vc
git pull

cd database/migrations
TERN_CONF="$HOME/.config/ocg/tern.conf" ./migrate.sh
```

Or run the same migration from the repository root:

```bash
cd ~/goup.vc
TERN_CONF="$HOME/.config/ocg/tern.conf" ./database/migrations/migrate.sh
```

Build the release binary in the background so it keeps running if the SSH
session disconnects, then restart the deployed service after the build finishes
successfully:

```bash
cd ~/goup.vc
nohup env CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 cargo build --release -p ocg-server > ~/goup-build.log 2>&1 &
tail -f ~/goup-build.log

sudo systemctl restart ocg-server
sudo systemctl status ocg-server --no-pager
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

For small EC2 instances, keep builds single-threaded:

```bash
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 cargo build --release -p ocg-server
```

If files under `mcp/` changed, restart the remote MCP service too:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart goup-mcp
sudo systemctl status goup-mcp --no-pager
```

### Troubleshooting

If `cargo build` fails with `tailwindcss not found in PATH`, install the
standalone Tailwind CSS binary and retry.

If migrations fail with `tern: command not found`, install it with:

```bash
go install github.com/jackc/tern/v2@v2.3.2
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```

If local login redirects behave strangely, confirm that `server.base_url`,
cookie settings, and provider redirect URIs match the URL you use in the
browser.

If Playwright tests fail because the browser executable is missing, run:

```bash
cd tests/unit
npx playwright install
```

For EC2 logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u ocg-server -n 100 --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u nginx -n 100 --no-pager
```
